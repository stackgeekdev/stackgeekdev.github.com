Getting OpenStack Essex installed and running for evaluation or production use can be difficult and time consuming. Here are a few of the guides/deployment scripts we've found for installing OpenStack (listed in no particular order):

1. Martin Loschwitz's [guide for installing Essex](http://www.hastexo.com/resources/docs/installing-openstack-essex-20121-ubuntu-1204-precise-pangolin) on Ubuntu 12.04.
2. OpenStack.org's [Install and Deploy Manual](http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-compute/install/content/) for Essex on Ubuntu 12.04.
3. Rackspace Cloud Builder group's [Chef cookbooks](https://github.com/rcbops/chef-cookbooks) for deploying Essex for RHEL/Debian/Fedora/CentOS.
4. Rackspace OpenStack developer's [devstack install](http://devstack.org/) script for deploying Folsom on Ubuntu 12.04 (not recommended for production use).
5. Emilien Macchi's [install guide and scripts](https://github.com/EmilienM/doc-openstack) for installing Essex on Ubuntu 12.04.
6. NII Cloud's [Dodai deploy scripts](https://github.com/nii-cloud/dodai) for installing Essex on Ubuntu 12.04.
